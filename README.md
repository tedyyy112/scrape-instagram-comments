##  Introduction
> Collect post comments and nested replies for analytics, moderation, and research. Built for makers, growth teams, and data engineers who need reliable pagination, nested-thread traversal, and resilient strategies when endpoints or GraphQL identifiers shift.

##  FAQs

**Q:** How many comments can I fetch?  
**A:** Practically, you can paginate through all available comments on a public post, constrained by rate limits, session quality, and proxies. With the official API (for eligible Business/Creator accounts), youâ€™ll page using cursors and reasonable limits per request; with headless/browser automation, use slower concurrency, randomized delays, and rotating proxies. At scale, teams commonly fetch thousands of comments across posts by batching requests and persisting cursors.

**Q:** How do I get nested replies?  
**A:** Use recursive traversal. For each top-level comment, request its replies (child thread) and attach `parent_id` references. In official endpoints, request fields that include replies/threads; in headless mode, capture the threaded structure from the postâ€™s comment UI or GraphQL response and walk each child list until no more `next_cursor` is returned.

**Q:** Do Instagram APIs / GraphQL doc_ids change?  
**A:** Yesâ€”internal GraphQL `doc_id`/query hashes are not stable and can change. To stay resilient: (1) prefer official APIs when eligible, (2) in scraping mode, discover query identifiers dynamically from network traffic at runtime, and (3) design a fallback that scrolls & renders comments in the UI, extracting from the DOM if a query hash breaks.
